# SMT-Soil-Moisture-Sensor-for-Arduino
Soil moisture and temperature sensor SMT-01

SMT-01 is designed to measure soil moisture and temperature for monitoring and automatic irrigation systems.
SMT-01 has a waterproof housing. SMT-01 provides measurement of parameters in a wide temperature range and in soils of different composition with high stability. SMT-01 is compatible with various microcontrollers, and the shielded cable allows data transmission up to 100m.
Main technical characteristics:
Supply voltage: 							3.3 - 5.0 V.
Current consumption in measurement mode: 	less than 	150 mA.
Standby current consumption: less than 			2 mA.
Measurement time: 						7-12 minutes.
Measurement error: less than 					2.5%.
Sensor dimensions: 						40x9x9 mm.
Connecting cable length: 					up to 100 m.
The sensor design is based on the dependence of the rate of dissipation of thermal energy on soil moisture (see Fig. 1).
Examples of electrical connection of the sensor and software for Arduino and ESP8266 microcontrollers are included.
